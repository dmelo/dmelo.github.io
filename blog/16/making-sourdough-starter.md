# Making sourdough starter

I have found very precise instructiont about how to make sourdough starter on
[Emma
Christensen's](http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-your-own-sourdough-starter-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-47337) post and I decided the instructions contained there. This post
is a replication of the experiment proposed on Emma's post. Considering hadling
bacteria is a very delicate subject, specially for newbies, this experiment have
very high chances to end in the garbage. On the other side, I have the help of
my wife, which can balance the odds for a more positive outcome.

## Day 1

I have measured 120 grams of flour and 120 grams of water. I mixed together on
a plastic container until it looked homogeneous, and left it resting for 36
hours. I've used a wooden spoon. The scale is made of plastic. No metal have
got into contact with dough.

It was left resting on a fresh, dry place with no direct sunlight. I'm using a
dishcloth to cover the container.

## Day 2


When I opened the container I've noticed a lot of bubbles, an increase in volume
and a fresh smell, like Emma have predicted. Also noticed that it had a slight
change in color, it was a bit more dark. When I mixed it, I've notice that it
was only a thin layer, that was in contact with the air. Beneath, the color
was the same as the day before.

I added 120 grams of flour and 120 grams of water to the mixture, stired it
until it became homogeneous again and put left it resting for another 24 hours.

## Day 3

When I've got home from day three I've noticed a funny smell on the house. It
was the sourdough starter. The smell reminded me of butter it was a bit strong,
sour. As far as I understand it might be due to the lactic acid produced by the
lactobacilli. Altough it is considered normal, a starter rich in lactic acid
bateria may result in a fast leaven and denser final product, which is not
desirable.

The dough had even more bubbles, seemed a bit darked then the original mixture,
as in day 2. After stir it, to feel the texture, it was clear that the mixture
was not longer homogeneous. A transparent liquid had separated from the dough. I
added 120 grams of flour and 120 grams of water, stired it carefully not to pour
the liquid from the container. This time, the texture was not a batter like, as
on the precioius days, but a bit more liquid.

Two hours after stiring it, I took more pictures:

I covered it with a plastic lid this time, to avoid the smell, and let it rest
for another 22 hours.
