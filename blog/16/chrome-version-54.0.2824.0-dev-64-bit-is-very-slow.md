Chrome was very slow lately. Some pages was taking a few seconds to load.
Scrolling the page had glitches. Googling around, I came accross this reddit
post 
[something interesting with chrome Version 54.0.2824.0 dev-m(64-bit)](https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/4xpwgq/something_interesting_with_chrome_version/)
One interesting thing though is that I checked that I wasn't logged in, in the
browser. After logging in, it looks like everything is back to normal.
